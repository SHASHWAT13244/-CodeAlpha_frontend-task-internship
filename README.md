# Music Player - Frontend Internship Project

This project is a fully functional **Music Player** developed as part of my **Frontend Development Internship** at **CodeAlpha**. It demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to build dynamic, interactive web applications.

### Task Overview:
As part of my **Task 4** for the internship, I was assigned to build a music player application that allows users to:
- Play, pause, and navigate through a playlist of songs.
- Control volume and track progress in real-time.
- Implement a visually appealing design using modern web technologies.

### Project Overview:
- **HTML**: Structured the application, embedding audio elements and creating a user-friendly interface.
- **CSS**: Styled the player with modern, responsive design, including animations and smooth transitions for a polished user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactive features, such as:
  - Play/pause functionality
  - Volume control
  - Song navigation (next/previous)
  - Real-time progress tracking

### Key Features:
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the player works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can control playback, volume, and navigate through the playlist.
- **Modern UI**: Visually appealing design with smooth transitions and subtle animations.

This project showcases my ability to build and style interactive web applications, and it reflects my commitment to delivering high-quality frontend solutions during my internship at CodeAlpha.
